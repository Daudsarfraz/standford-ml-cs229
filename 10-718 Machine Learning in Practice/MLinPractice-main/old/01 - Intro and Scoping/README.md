## Introduction to the goals of the Class 
[Slides](ClassOverview.pptx)

On Tuesday, we’ll  provide  an  introduction  to  the  class,  its  goals,  and  an  overview  of  the project options to help you decide what you’re interested in working on for the remainder of the semester.

Notes for Tuesday:
- Different from previous iterations of the course, project-driven
- Note that there isn't a single lecture on the syllabus about ML methods, class is about everything that happens before and after building a model, which is where you spend most of your time anyway
- Unfortunately, no single textbook or set of readings exist for this type of course. The readings we've selected for each class speak to elements of the topics, but lectures will be critical to get a more complete understanding

During the Wednesday session, we'll help ensure everyone is set up to access the class technical resources.

## Tech Session

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MEP-UF9dHuEfoIWWKIphFAYI23miVHCovLJgndPLgvE/edit?usp=sharing)

This tech session will set you up to access to the class infrastructure: the course server via SSH, the database via command line and GUI, and the course github.

Don't worry if any of these topics are unfamiliar to you - future tech sessions will cover them in greater depth.

## ML Project Scoping 

[Slides](Scoping.pptx) and [Scoping Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17svWoaRrRCjsROb2UxOVKPY86GyyRuiJMnPgjL2IkKg/edit)

On Thursday, we’ll talk about scoping, problem definition, and understanding and balancing organizational goals.  Well before the outset of technical work, a decision needs to be made about whether a given policy problem can and should be addressed with machine learning: 
- Is the problem significant, feasible to solve with a technical approach, and of sufficient importance to policy makers that they will devote resources to implementing the solution? 
- How will success be measured? 
- How will (often competing) goals of efficiency, effectiveness, andequity be balanced?

We'll present and discuss our project scoping methodology that you will be expected to use in the class projects.
