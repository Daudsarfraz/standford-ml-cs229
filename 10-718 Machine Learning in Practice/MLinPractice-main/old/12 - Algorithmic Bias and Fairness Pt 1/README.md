## Project Work
By this week, you should be finalizing your modeling results and
beginning to look at bias and disparities in your models. 

**Due Monday, Nov 16**: Weekly project update.

## Tuesday: Algorithmic Bias and Fairness, Part I
Just as important as assessing whether your model is making accurate
predictions is determining whether it is doing so in a fair
manner. But, what do we mean by fairness? How can you measure it and
what can you do to mitigate any disparities you might find? Where in
your pipeline can bias be introduced? (spoiler: everywhere). This week
will provide a very brief introduction to the expansive field of
algorithmic fairness.
